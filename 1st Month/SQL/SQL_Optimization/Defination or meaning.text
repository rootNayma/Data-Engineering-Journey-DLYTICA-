What is indexing ??
Indexing is a method to eliminate all the irrelevent rows to save time and storage which only scans needed rows or data, it is done in row-level inside table.
Thik hai bhai, row-level yaad kariyo.

What is Partition ??
Partition is a method which will splits one big table into samll pieces of table and doesnt scans data itself it needs help of pruning.
help of pruning what you mean-- ruuko jara sabar karo, i will expalin

What is Prunning ??
Prunning is a sub method of partition which will eliminate all the irrelevent partitoned table which only scans the needed partitioned table only. 
It is done in partitioned table-level. yaad kariyo 
Without partition there is no prunning,  it is like a new couple without him she doesnt eat food, and without her he doesnt eat food. 
Partition + Prunning = Love Forever

Now lets do a Summary,

Partitioning
What it does                    : Splits a big table into smaller tables (partitions).
What it doesnâ€™t do              : It does not scan or filter data.
Purpose                         : Enables pruning and better management of large datasets.

Pruning
What it does                    : At query time, decides which partitions to scan.
How it works                    : Only scans the partitions that could possibly contain matching rows.
Level                           : Partition-level (skips whole tables).
Depends on                      : The table being partitioned.

Index
What it does                    : Speeds up row-level lookups inside a table or partition.
Level                           : Row-level (inside a table).
Independent of partitions       : You can use an index on a normal table or a partitioned table.

ruk bahi ruk, aabhi baaki hai.
Lets Visualize it,  suppose you need book 2023


Partition	----------------------> Each floor = collection of books,           book2020, book2021, book2023, book2024

Pruning	------------------------> Go only to the floor which has book2023,    Then skip all other floors.

Index --------------------------> On that floor, use a catalog to open the door and grap exact book you needed.  Gotcha book2023.
